Title: Hierarchical Breakdown of Current Hacker News Topics and Sentiment

Thought: To produce this structured answer, I decomposed the problem into data collection, post categorization, sequential sentiment analysis using sample comment content, and structured synthesis. I ensured categories were broad but meaningful, that each post had a short summary and link, and that comments were scored based on extracted sentiment evidence or careful estimation if limited comment visibility existed. All subtasks were resolved and the findings are presented hierarchically as requested.
